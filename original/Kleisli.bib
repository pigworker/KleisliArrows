  abstract = {Monads were introduced in computer science to express the semantics
  of programs with computational effects, while type and effect
  inference was introduced to mark out those effects.
  In this article, we propose a combination of the notions of effects
  and monads, where the monadic operators are parameterized by effects.
  We establish some relationships between those generalized monads and
  the classical ones.
  Then we use a generalized monad to translate imperative programs
  into purely functional ones. We establish the correctness of that
  translation. This work has been put into practice in the Coq proof
  assistant to establish the correctness of imperative programs.}
